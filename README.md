### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm John Knott, a software engineer with 20 years of experience.

My most recent full-time role was as Head of Engineering at www.meetupcall.com.

I really enjoyed aspects of that role but it also made me realise I prefer more hands-on technical positions.

Recently I have been working with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) on the back-end and various front-end technologies - mainly [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I have also recent mobile application development experience with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

I am currently available for contract work - check out my [CV](https://johnknott.co.uk) if you are interested.
